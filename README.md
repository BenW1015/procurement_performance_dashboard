# Procurement Performance Dashboard | Power BI + SQL + Snowflake
Built a Power BI dashboard using supplier and purchase order data. Managed data in Snowflake with SQL and DAX, created KPIs for defect rate, lead time, and supplier performance, and added interactive filters for item-level insights. Helped improve vendor performance and operational efficiency.

# Executive Summary:
This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to track and improve procurement efficiency and supplier performance. Using real-world procurement data, I transformed raw datasets into meaningful insights that help stakeholders make smarter, data-driven decisions.
The dashboard highlights supplier defect rates, on-time delivery, lead time trends, and category-level spend, giving leadership a clear, visual view of overall supplier health and operational performance.

# Business Problem:
The procurement team lacked a centralized and visual way to evaluate supplier reliability and identify underperforming vendors. Manual reporting caused delays and made it difficult to pinpoint issues like high defect rates or long lead times.
The goal was to create a data-driven solution that simplifies supplier analysis, improves decision-making, and supports strategic vendor management.

# Methods used:
Data Extraction & Loading: Imported supplier and purchase order data into Snowflake for centralized storage.
Data Transformation: Cleaned and modeled data using SQL queries and optimized relationships for Power BI.
Dashboard Development: Created interactive Power BI visuals using DAX to calculate key performance metrics (KPIs) such as defect rate, average lead time, and on-time delivery %.
User Experience Design: Added drill-through pages and slicers for flexible, self-service analysis across supplier, item, and category levels.

# Skills:
Power BI • SQL • Snowflake • Data Modeling • DAX • ETL • Data Visualization • KPI Development • Procurement Analytics • Data Storytelling

# Results and Business Recommendation:
Created a single source of truth for procurement insights, reducing manual reporting time.
Improved visibility into supplier performance trends and lead time variability.
Identified high-risk suppliers and opportunities to improve on-time delivery and product quality.
Recommendation: Use these insights in quarterly supplier reviews to strengthen vendor partnerships and implement data-driven improvement plans.

# Next Steps:
Incorporate forecasting models to predict potential delivery delays.
Add automated data refresh and Power BI alerts for real-time monitoring.
Expand dashboard to include spend optimization and inventory analysis.
